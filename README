Emacs has this inferior-lisp mode where you can send lisp forms to a running lisp image. This can either be a common-lisp (although Slime is more specialized at that), or a scheme, or as it turns out, it can be emacs itself.

Put these two files in a directory someplace,

Then, simply tell emacs to make ee.sh your inferior-lisp-program.

Before the novelty wears off, a better version might simply be a reader that speaks emacsclient...
